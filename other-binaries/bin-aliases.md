# bin/aliases

* Code: [https://github.com/abesto/bitburner-scripts-2/blob/main/src/bin/aliases.ts](https://github.com/abesto/bitburner-scripts-2/blob/main/src/bin/aliases.ts)

This is a very simple script that saves me _so much time_. It scans the folder at runtime where binaries live, and prints commands to create aliases for running each. I copy-paste the whole thing when adding a new binary (or just the one I care about at the moment), and move on with life.
